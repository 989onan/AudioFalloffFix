# AudioFalloffFix

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) A Resonite mod that allows you to change audio falloff for all logmarithic falloffs locally.

The settings menu kinda sucks rn. I want to add draggable graphs for all audio groups.

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
1. Place [AudioFalloffFix.dll](https://github.com/989onan/AudioFalloffFix/releases/latest/download/AudioFalloffFix.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.
